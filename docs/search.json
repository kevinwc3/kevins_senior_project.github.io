I need to identify specific groups of students that are less likely to take these surveys. I will be creating a report with visualizations, tables, and statistics for my results.\n\nSince this post doesn’t specify an explicit image, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts."

Now that I’ve found these groups, I’m putting together a simple presentation illustrating how these groups change over time. I’ve also included a chart with the average response rates for all students for comparison. My next step is to gather demographic data for each of these response groups to compare with the panels demographics."
