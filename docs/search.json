Now that I’ve found these groups, I’m putting together a simple presentation illustrating how these groups change over time. I’ve also included a chart with the average response rates for all students for comparison. My next step is to gather demographic data for each of these response groups to compare with the panels demographics."

I then ran a random forest machine learning model to varify some of my findings and potentially find more important variables. My model confirmed my findings and also provided me with a new variable that I hadn’t looked into before. Finally I need to create an alluvial plot to track student responses and finalize my presentation."
