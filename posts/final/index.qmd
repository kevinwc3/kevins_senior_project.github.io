I finalized my presentation in a RMD file and presented it as a html file. This presentation brought up many questions about current processes. We learned that the results of our surveys could really only be trusted at a high level because of the lack of responses in many areas. Some results were being posted that couldn't fully be trusted. While this project answered a few questions, it seemed to provide even more.
