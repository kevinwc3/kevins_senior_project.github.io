I was able to gather demographic data and create tables with demographic summaries. I then ran a random forest machine learning model to varify some of my findings and potentially find more important variables. My model confirmed my findings and also provided me with a new variable that I hadn't looked into before. Finally I need to create an alluvial plot to track student responses and finalize my presentation.
